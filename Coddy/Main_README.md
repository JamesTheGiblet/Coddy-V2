# Coddy: Your Sentient AI Dev Partner

**Repository:** [https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/Coddy-V2.git](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/Coddy-V2.git)

Coddy is designed to be your intelligent and adaptable AI development partner. It aims to translate your unique coding style and methodology into a format others can easily understand and utilize. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Gemini, Coddy intelligently adjusts to your individual needs, streamlines your workflow, and fosters a smarter, more intuitive development experience.

## Core Philosophy

Coddy's development is guided by a strong philosophy focused on modern, efficient, and user-centric practices:

* **MERN-native. Async-first. No retrofits:** Coddy is built from the ground up with asynchronous operations and a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) compatible backend, ensuring a robust and scalable foundation.
* **Chaos-aware. Memory-rich:** Coddy doesn't just remember; it intelligently recognizes patterns and context, allowing it to adapt to unpredictable development environments.
* **CLI to Cloud. Terminal to UI:** Whether you prefer the command line or a visual interface, Coddy provides a seamless experience, ensuring your context is always available.
* **Vibe > Convention. Async > Sync. Improvise > Optimize:** We prioritize intuitive flow, asynchronous efficiency, and creative problem-solving over rigid conventions.
* **Coddy helps build you — while you build Coddy:** Coddy is designed to learn from your interactions, continuously improving its capabilities as you use it.

## Foundational Architecture

Coddy is built on an async-native, MERN-compatible foundation, including:

* **Core Backend (Coddy API / Async Architecture):** An Express server with async/await native services.
* **Data Persistence (Mongo Memory):** MongoDB for long-term memory and bug logs.
* **Frontend Shell (React CLI Shell):** A React-based terminal-style UI for an interactive dashboard.

## Development Roadmap

Coddy's development follows a phased approach to systematically build out its advanced features. Each phase is designed to add significant capabilities, moving towards a truly sentient and intelligent development companion.

### Key Phases Overview

* **Phase 0: Seed the Vision:** Defining the core philosophy, vision, and initial roadmap.
* **Phase 1: Build the Core Skeleton & Breathe:** Establishing a testable CLI and foundational Express + MongoDB backend.
* **Phase 2: Add Memory & Planning Logic:** Implementing context-aware memory, planning, and pattern analysis.
* **Phase 3: Enable Creative Intelligence & Talk and See:** Adding ideation capabilities and a React-based UI for visualization.
* **Phase 4: Add Vibe-Driven Workflow Tools:** Introducing tools for progress tracking, context-switching reduction, and coding focus.
* **Phase 5: The Personalization Engine v1.0:** Finalizing the prototype with initial personalization, validation, and comprehensive testing.
* **Phase 6: Git-Awareness Engine:** Integrating advanced Git analysis for real-time repository insights.
* **Phase 7: The Visual Canvas (Dashboard):** Establishing a visual dashboard for interactive project tracking and ideation.
* **Phase 8: Proactive Builder Engine:** Empowering Coddy to generate, refactor, and scaffold code and UIs autonomously.
* **Phase 9: The Plugin SDK:** Establishing a robust plugin system for extensibility and integrations, including local LLMs.
* **Phase 10: The Sentient Loop (Self-Improvement):** Enabling Coddy to autonomously test, refactor, and improve its own codebase.
* **Phase 11: The Collaborator (Team Features):** Introducing shared project state, async task assignment, and team checkpoints.
* **Phase 12: The Deployable Service:** Transforming Coddy into a deployable, API-driven service via Docker.
* **Phase 13: The Environment Integrator (IDE & Shell):** Deepening integration with VS Code and shell environments, adding proactive suggestions.
* **Phase 14: The Autonomous Agent:** Enabling advanced autonomous capabilities for planning, multi-step execution, and self-correction.
* **Phase 15: The Personalization Engine v2.0:** Developing a robust engine for continuous learning and adaptation to user preferences.
* **Phase 16: The Interactive Cockpit:** Centralizing code generation, refactoring, file management, and automation in a unified visual workspace.
* **Phase 17: The Skillful Agent & Smart Skills Engine:** Establishing a robust "Skill" system for complex, reusable operations.
* **Phase 18: The Vibe-Centric Visual Cockpit:** Redesigning the dashboard for intuitive coding focus, planning, and creativity.
* **Phase 19: The Universal LLM Connector:** Flexible interface for integrating and managing multiple LLM providers.
* **Phase 20: The Proactive Knowledge Weaver:** Enabling Coddy to self-learn from feedback and project context.
* **Phase 21: The Preference & Style Engine:** Building core systems for personal development "fingerprint" and Genesis experience.
* **Phase 22: The Interactive Interpreter:** Developing a conversational Q&A system for detailed project briefs.
* **Phase 23: The Adaptive Generators:** Building engines for style-aware project document generation.
* **Phase 24: The Project Scaffolder:** Creating functionality to build actual project workspaces (local or GitHub).
* **Phase 25: The Final Vibe:** Completing the Genesis experience and linking it back to the coding workflow.
* **Phase 26: The Experimental Playground:** Exploring advanced, experimental features for creativity and project coherence.
* **Phase 27: Coddy Clones & Vibe-Oriented Sync:** Expanding Coddy’s ecosystem with persona-driven clones, isolated experimentation, and context-syncing.
* **Phase 28: Final Review & Future Planning:** Assessing the overall prototype and outlining future strategic direction.
