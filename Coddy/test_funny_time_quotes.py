```python
import unittest
from your_module import funny_time_quote  # Replace your_module

class TestFunnyTimeQuote(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_returns_string(self):
        quote = funny_time_quote()
        self.assertIsInstance(quote, str)

    def test_string_not_empty(self):
        quote = funny_time_quote()
        self.assertTrue(len(quote) > 0)  # Or self.assertNotEmpty(quote) if using a newer unittest version


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import unittest`**:  This line imports the necessary `unittest` module, which is Python's built-in testing framework.
* **`from your_module import funny_time_quote`**:  *Crucially*, this line imports the function you want to test.  **You MUST replace `your_module` with the actual name of the Python file where `funny_time_quote` is defined.**  Without this, the test will fail because it can't find the function.
* **`class TestFunnyTimeQuote(unittest.TestCase)`**: This defines a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.  All your test methods will go inside this class.  The class name should be descriptive.
* **`def test_returns_string(self):`**:  This defines a test method.  *The name of the method MUST start with `test_`*.  This tells `unittest` that this is a test to be run.  `self` is a reference to the test class instance.
* **`quote = funny_time_quote()`**: This calls the function you're testing and stores the result in the `quote` variable.
* **`self.assertIsInstance(quote, str)`**: This is an *assertion*.  It checks that the `quote` variable is a string.  If it's not, the test will fail. `assertIsInstance` is the correct assertion to use for type checking.
* **`def test_string_not_empty(self):`**: Another test method, this one checks that the string is not empty.
* **`self.assertTrue(len(quote) > 0)`**:  This checks that the length of the string is greater than 0. If the string is empty, the test fails.  Using `assertTrue` with a boolean condition is perfectly valid.
* **`# self.assertNotEmpty(quote) if using a newer unittest version`**:  This is a commented-out alternative using `assertNotEmpty`.  It's available in newer versions of `unittest` (Python 3.1+).  It's more readable than `assertTrue(len(quote) > 0)`, but I've left the `assertTrue` version as the primary one for broader compatibility.
* **`if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()`**: This is standard boilerplate code that runs the tests when you execute the Python file.  It's important to include this.

How to run the test:

1.  **Save the code:** Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_funny_time_quote.py`).  Make sure it's in the same directory as your `your_module.py` file (the file containing the `funny_time_quote` function).
2.  **Replace `your_module`:**  Make sure you've replaced `your_module` with the actual name of your module.
3.  **Run from the command line:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the command:

    ```bash
    python test_funny_time_quote.py
    ```

    or, if you're using Python 3:

    ```bash
    python3 test_funny_time_quote.py
    ```

    You will see output indicating whether the tests passed or failed.  If a test fails, it will give you an error message to help you diagnose the problem.
