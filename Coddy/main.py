This code integrates a clock display with a function that plays a funny sound or phrase.  Because I don't have access to your specific sound files or preferred phrase, I'll provide placeholders.  You'll need to replace these with your actual resources.  This example uses `playsound` for audio playback; you may need to install it (`pip install playsound`).

```python
import time
import datetime
import os
from playsound import playsound #Requires installation: pip install playsound

def play_funny_sound():
    """Plays a funny sound or says a funny phrase."""
    try:
        # Replace 'path/to/your/funny_sound.mp3' with the actual path
        playsound('path/to/your/funny_sound.mp3') 
    except playsound.PlaysoundException as e:
        print(f"Error playing sound: {e}")
        try:
            #Fallback to a text-based "funny" phrase if sound fails
            print("Boing!  That was supposed to be a funny sound!")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error with fallback: {e}")


def display_clock():
    """Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format."""
    while True:
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        current_time = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
        print(f"\rCurrent time: {current_time}", end="", flush=True)  # \r for carriage return, clears previous line
        time.sleep(1)


def main():
    """Main function to run the clock and play the sound at intervals."""
    try:
      sound_interval = 60 # Play sound every 60 seconds (adjust as needed)

      clock_thread = threading.Thread(target=display_clock)
      clock_thread.daemon = True  # Allow the program to exit even if the clock thread is running
      clock_thread.start()

      while True:
          time.sleep(sound_interval)
          play_funny_sound()

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
      print("\nClock stopped.")
    except Exception as e:
      print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

import threading
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Remember to replace `"path/to/your/funny_sound.mp3"` with the correct path to your sound file.  If you want a different interval for the funny sound, change the `sound_interval` variable.  This improved version uses threading to allow the clock to run concurrently with the sound playback.  This prevents the clock from freezing while a sound plays.
