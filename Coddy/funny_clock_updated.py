Okay, I can help you modify `funny_clock.py` to use `potato_message_generator.py` for the hourly messages.

To give you a more tailored response, please provide the contents of both `funny_clock.py` and `potato_message_generator.py`.  This will allow me to:

1.  **Understand the existing code:**  I need to know how `funny_clock.py` currently generates its messages and the structure of `potato_message_generator.py`.
2.  **Integrate them seamlessly:**  I can make sure the integration is smooth and avoids any compatibility issues.
3.  **Provide complete, runnable code:** You'll get code that (hopefully!) works right away.

Once you provide the code, I'll generate the modified `funny_clock.py` with the `potato_message_generator.py` integration.  I'll also explain the changes I made.
